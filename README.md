Requirements:


There's a NxN connection matrix. 

We don't need to optimize area, we just want best connectivity 

Cost function: (grid-to-grid) * num-connections-between-boxes

So we have to find a way to determine distance between two boxes. 

Distances can be updated with a minimum value gridSize
